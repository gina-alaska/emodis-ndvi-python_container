# Creating a Docker container for processing NDVI Metric products in HTC
This read.me is written as part of a challenge for the Polar Cyber Infrastrcture Hackathon (Stony Brook, NY August 2017)



# Success for this hackathon looks like:
* set up Docker in HTC
* migrate code into system

#### Ultimate goal: 
By January 2018 automate application for yearly process of data into NDVI metrics product for NDVI Metrics. Be able to store raw data, results data, and algorithms / application for free or cheaply.

## Project components:
* source files from MODIS-NDVI
* algorithm / application - python code in docker container for HTC for processing and storage
* HTC
* Docker


## History of NDVI Metrics project and UAF-GINA:
* 2010 created code for processing 
* The code is running yearly to process NDVI metrics
